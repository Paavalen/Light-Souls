# Light Souls

Welcome to Light Souls - a simple 2D shooting game built with JavaFX!

## Overview

Light Souls is a game where you control a character in a 2D environment and aim to survive against waves of enemies. As you progress, the game becomes more challenging, requiring quick reflexes and precise aiming to defeat the enemies and stay alive.

## Features

- **Player Control**: Use the keyboard or mouse to control the player character's movement and shooting.
- **Enemy Waves**: Enemies spawn periodically and move towards the player character. Your objective is to eliminate them before they reach you.
- **Health Bar**: Keep an eye on your character's health bar. If it reaches zero, it's game over!
- **Obstacle**: Breakable blocks spawn, reducing the playable space making the game more challenging
